# NBA Data Analysis Project

## What is this project?

This is a data analysis project that looks at NBA basketball teams and how they perform. It collects information about teams from the NBA website and analyzes their stats to understand which teams are doing well and why.

## What does it do?

The project does several things:

1. **Collects NBA Data**: Gets team statistics from the NBA's official website, including:
   - Wins and losses
   - Points scored
   - Shooting percentages
   - Rebounds and assists
   - And many other stats

2. **Analyzes Current Season**: Looks at the 2024-25 season to see:
   - Which teams are winning the most
   - How teams compare to each other
   - Performance differences between Eastern and Western conferences

3. **Studies Historical Data**: Examines data from past seasons (1996-2024) to:
   - See how teams have performed over time
   - Compare current performance to historical trends
   - Understand team success patterns

4. **Creates Visualizations**: Makes charts and graphs showing:
   - Bar charts of wins and losses
   - Scatter plots comparing different stats
   - Heatmaps of team performance
   - Comparisons between expected and actual results

5. **Predicts Success**: Uses machine learning to predict which teams are likely to be successful based on their statistics.

## What tools were used?

- **Python**: The main programming language
- **Pandas**: For organizing and working with data tables
- **Requests**: To get data from the NBA website
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating charts and graphs
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictions
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and running the code

## What was learned?

Through this project, several interesting things were discovered:

1. **Data Collection**: How to get data from websites using Python and handle large amounts of information
2. **Data Cleaning**: How to organize messy data into useful formats
3. **Data Visualization**: How to create charts that make data easy to understand
4. **Statistical Analysis**: How to compare different teams and find patterns in their performance
5. **Machine Learning**: How to use computer programs to predict outcomes based on data
6. **API Usage**: How to work with websites that provide data in structured formats

## Key Findings

- The project successfully collected data for all 30 NBA teams
- It analyzed both current season performance and historical trends
- Created visual comparisons between Eastern and Western conference teams
- Built a model that can predict team success based on various statistics
- Demonstrated how data science can be applied to sports analysis

## Files in the Project

- `nba.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the analysis code
- `team_stats_24-25.csv`: Current season statistics for all teams
- `fullTeam_stats.csv`: Historical statistics for all teams across multiple seasons
- `README.md`: This file explaining the project

This project shows how programming and data analysis can be used to understand sports performance and make predictions about team success.
