# NBA Finals Data Analysis Project

## What is this project?

This is a data analysis project that looks at the 2024-25 NBA season, specifically focusing on the teams that made it to the finals: the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers. The project collects and analyzes data about how these teams performed during the regular season versus the playoffs, and how fans engaged with them.

## What does it do?

The project answers several key questions:

- **Team Performance**: How did the Thunder and Pacers perform in the regular season compared to the playoffs?
- **Attendance Analysis**: Which team had better attendance at home games during playoffs vs. regular season?
- **Player Comparisons**: How did star players like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Thunder) and Tyrese Haliburton (Pacers) perform?
- **Fan Engagement**: How did social media following and Google search interest change for each team?
- **Win vs. Attendance**: How did winning games relate to fan attendance for each team?

## What tools were used?

- **Python**: The main programming language for data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and running the analysis code
- **Pandas**: For handling and organizing data tables
- **Requests**: For getting data from NBA statistics websites
- **Beautiful Soup**: For scraping social media follower data
- **Google Trends API**: For tracking search interest over time
- **SQL**: For creating database tables to store the data
- **CSV files**: For saving and organizing the collected data
