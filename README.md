- **NumPy**: For mathematical calculations and number crunching
- **NBA API**: Official tool to get live basketball statistics from the NBA website

### Data Storage
- **CSV Files**: Simple spreadsheet format to save basketball data
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system to store and organize large amounts of game data
- **SQL**: Language to ask questions and get specific information from the database

### Data Visualization & Dashboards
- **Matplotlib**: Creates basic charts and graphs
- **Seaborn**: Makes more attractive and detailed charts
- **Plotly**: Interactive charts that you can click and explore
- **Streamlit**: Builds web dashboards that update in real-time with live game data

### Web Development & APIs
- **Requests**: Tool to download data from NBA websites
- **Streamlit**: Creates interactive web applications for viewing basketball statistics

   - Tracks team statistics over time
   - Analyzes attendance and fan engagement

4. **Finals Recap** (`finals_recap/`)
   - Summary of entire playoff series
   - Key turning points and momentum analysis
   - Player performance comparisons

## How to Use

1. **For Data Analysis**: Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to see how data is collected and analyzed
2. **For Live Dashboard**: Run the Streamlit app to see real-time basketball statistics
3. **For Data Files**: Check the CSV files for processed basketball statistics
4. **For Database**: Use the SQL files to set up your own basketball database
